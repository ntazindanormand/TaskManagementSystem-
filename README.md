## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations:
1. **User Authentication** üö´  
   Right now, there‚Äôs no login system, so anyone using the browser can access the tasks. A login system would make this more personal and secure.

2. **Data Stored Locally** üñ•Ô∏è  
   Tasks are stored in your browser's local storage, so if you switch devices or clear the browser data, your tasks will be lost. A database would solve this!

### Future improvements:
1. **User Accounts & Authentication** üîê  
   We could add login functionality so each user has their own tasks.

2. **Cloud Storage** ‚òÅÔ∏è  
   Imagine saving your tasks to the cloud so you can access them from anywhere‚Äîthis would be possible with a backend database (like SQLite or MongoDB).

3. **Task Prioritization** 
   Mark tasks as High, Medium, or Low priority to stay super organized.

4. **Reminders & Notifications** 
   A reminder system that notifies you when a task is nearing its due date.

5. **UI Improvements** 
  A more visually appealing with enhanced design and smoother animations.
