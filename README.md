# Task Management System 

Welcome to the Task Management System! This is a simple, yet powerful tool designed to help you stay organized by managing your tasks efficiently. You can create, edit, delete, and filter tasks with ease, keeping track of what's important. Let's dive in!

## 🌟 Features

### Core Features:
1. **Create New Tasks** ✏️  
   Easily add tasks with just a few clicks! Each task can have a title, description, category, and due date. Perfect for staying on top of your work.
   
2. **Task Status: Complete or Incomplete** ✅❌  
   Keep track of what’s done and what’s still on your to-do list. With one click, you can mark tasks as complete or revert them back to incomplete.

3. **Edit Task Details** 🔄  
   Made a mistake or need to update something? No problem! Simply edit your tasks by clicking the "Edit" button and updating the info.

4. **Delete Tasks**  
   Tidy up your task list by removing completed or unnecessary tasks.

5. **Visual Task List**  
   See all your tasks in one place with a clear visual indication of their current status.

6. **Filter Tasks**   
   Need to focus on specific tasks? Use filters to show tasks by their status (complete/incomplete) or category (Work, Personal, Others).

7. **Search Tasks**  
   Quickly find tasks by title using the search bar—no more scrolling endlessly to find that one task!

8. **Persistent Storage**  
   Your tasks are saved automatically using local storage. Even if you refresh or close the browser, your tasks will still be there when you come back!

### Bonus Features
1. **Categories for Better Organization** 
   Organize your tasks into categories like Work, Personal, or Others. This makes it super easy to see what's related to different areas of your life.

2. **Set Due Dates** 
   Never miss a deadline! Add due dates to tasks so you know when they need to be completed.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations:
1. **User Authentication** 🚫  
   Right now, there’s no login system, so anyone using the browser can access the tasks. A login system would make this more personal and secure.

2. **Data Stored Locally** 🖥️  
   Tasks are stored in your browser's local storage, so if you switch devices or clear the browser data, your tasks will be lost. A database would solve this!

### What’s Coming in the Future:
1. **User Accounts & Authentication** 🔐  
   We could add login functionality so each user has their own tasks.

2. **Cloud Storage** ☁️  
   Imagine saving your tasks to the cloud so you can access them from anywhere—this would be possible with a backend database (like SQLite or MongoDB).

3. **Task Prioritization** 
   Mark tasks as High, Medium, or Low priority to stay super organized.

4. **Reminders & Notifications** 
   A reminder system that notifies you when a task is nearing its due date.

5. **UI Improvements** 
   We’re planning to make the app even more visually appealing with enhanced design and smoother animations.

##  What I Learned & Challenges I Faced


This project was a fantastic way for me to dive deeper into JavaScript and working with local storage. One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the filters worked well with both status and search functionality, but after a few tweaks, it came together nicely!
